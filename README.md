# music-source-separation-literature-review
A structured literature review of Music Source Separation research, analyzing 70+ papers across architectures, datasets, and evaluation metrics.

## Overview
This repository contains an ongoing literature mapping study on Music Source Separation (MSS) research. The project aims to build a structured understanding of deep learning approaches for separating musical sources from mixture signals.

So far, more than 70 research papers have been reviewed at the abstract and methodological overview level. A structured comparative framework has been designed to enable deeper cross-paper analysis, with detailed entries currently being expanded.

## Objectives:
- Map the evolution of deep learning architectures in MSS
- Compare models across datasets and evaluation metrics
- Identify performance trends and methodological shifts
- Highlight open research challenges and gaps
- Build a structured reference framework for future research

## Comparison Framework:
Each paper is analyzed using a structured comparison table including:
- Model Architecture (CNN, U-Net, Transformer, Hybrid, etc.)
- Input Representation (Time-domain, Spectrogram, Hybrid)
- Dataset (MUSDB18, WHAM!, custom datasets, etc.)
- Evaluation Metrics (SDR, SI-SDR, PESQ, etc.)
- Supervision Type
- Real-time Capability
- Computational Considerations
- Strengths and Limitations

## Current Progress:
- 70+ papers identified and summarized
- Abstract-level analysis completed
- Comparative framework designed
- Detailed structured comparisons currently in progress for selected key papers

## Purpose:
- This project serves both as:
- A structured academic review resource
- A foundation for future research contributions in Music Source Separation
